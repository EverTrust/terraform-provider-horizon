```terraform
# Manage example certificate
resource "horizon_certificate" "example" {
  subject {
    element = "CN"
    type    = "CN"
    value   = "example.terraform.cn"
  }
  sans {
    element = "DNSNAME"
    type    = "DNSNAME"
    value   = "example.terraform.dnsname"
  }
  labels {
    label   = "label"
    value   = "example"
  }
  profile   = "Enrollment Profile"
  key_type  = "rsa-2048"  
  revoke_on_delete = false
