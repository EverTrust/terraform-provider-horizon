# Horizon Provider

The Horizon Provider is used to manage the life cycle of certificates.

## Example Usage

You can authenticate with credentials

```terraform
provider "horizon" {
  alias    = "with-creds"
  endpoint = "https://horizon.example"

  username = "example"
  password = "example"
}
```

Or with a certificate and a key

```terraform
provider "horizon" {
  alias = "with-cert"

  endpoint = "https://horizon.company.com"
  cert     = "----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
  key      = "----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
}
```
